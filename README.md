# Info

The project was created as part of participation in the [Hackathon "Code Rocks" 2023](https://vk.com/code_rocks_hack_2023)  in the "development of a mobile application - ridesharing service" category among non-professionals. The final score was 97/200.
The competition took place over several days during which a minimally viable product was developed according to the requirements of a junior developer.

# Result

Our team scored 97 out of 200 points, which is a fairly decent result for the first time. Going forward, we'll strive for more.
> This experience has shown what we need to learn, and it's not just programming but also the ability to speak effectively during project presentations.
